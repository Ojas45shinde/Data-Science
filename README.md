# 🧠 Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects I’ve worked on to explore, analyze, and model real-world data using a variety of tools and techniques
in data science and machine learning.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

Here’s a brief list of the projects currently included:

- **[Project 1]( SVM Classification )**  
  SVM classification using in built dataset (digits_dataset)
